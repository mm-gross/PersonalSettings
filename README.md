# PersonalSettings

I created this project is to have all of my personal preferences for all command line tools that I use frequently (or infrequently) in one place. 
It started out just as a collection of different config files, but it grew beyond that and I have some ideas for further improvements.

In the long run, I'd like to have something (at the time of writing, there's a rudimentary shell script, but that might change in the future) that can automatically deploy not only my configurations but maybe also install all the software, I want installed, to speed up the setup of a new machine.

Of course this is strongly tailored to my personal needs and preferences, but hopefully at least some part of it might be useful for others too.
