This project is available under a dual license of Beerware and MIT License.
That means, it's up to you under which license you want to use any of this stuff.
You can choose either license or stick with both.

Personally I prefer the Beerware license, but decided to provide the MIT License
as sort of a "backup", if you need something more formal.

If you are working on a commercial project, really need my code to help you along
and neither license works for you, hit me up. I'm sure we can work something out,
we might both benefit from.

## Beerware License

"THE BEER-WARE LICENSE" (Revision 42):
Marc Groß <marc@marc-gross.de> wrote this file.  As long as you retain this notice you
can do whatever you want with this stuff. If we meet some day, and you think
this stuff is worth it, you can buy me a beer in return.
